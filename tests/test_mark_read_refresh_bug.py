"""
Test for the "400 unread items after mark all as read + refresh" bug.

This test verifies that articles marked as read are NOT resurrected as unread
after a refresh, even when retention cleanup runs.

Bug scenario:
1. User marks all items as read
2. refresh_feeds() is called, which runs cleanup_old_articles()
3. Cleanup deletes those read articles
4. User presses F5 to refresh RSS feeds
5. RSS feeds return their last 400 entries
6. Since those articles were deleted, they're re-inserted as unread
7. BUG: 400 old articles appear as unread even though they were marked as read

Fix:
- Moved cleanup from _refresh_feeds_worker (tree update) to _run_refresh (network fetch)
- Cleanup now runs BEFORE RSS fetch, not AFTER mark_all_read
- This ensures deleted articles won't be immediately re-fetched
